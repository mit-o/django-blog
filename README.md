#### Django Blog
My first django project created in October '20 by following a Corey Schafer's [django tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p).

#### Setup and installations
1. Install and activate your virtual environment with python 3.5+

2. Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements-dev.yml```

3. Create database with migrations by entering ```python manage.py migrate```

4. Create an admin user using ```python manage.py createsuperuser```

5. Run the development server by entering ```python manage.py runserver```
